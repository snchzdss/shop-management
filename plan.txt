When developing a **shop management system** like the one you've described (with separate cashier and admin functionalities), the best approach is to **break the project down into phases**, following **a logical order** based on:

* Dependencies (what features need to exist before others)
* Core functionality (what‚Äôs essential to even run the system)
* User roles (cashier vs. admin)
* Iterative development (start small, grow from there)

---

### ‚úÖ **Recommended Development Order**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step roadmap:

---

### **üü¢ PHASE 1: System Foundation (Backend & Authentication)**

This phase ensures that the core engine of your system is working, and secure access is in place.

1. **User Authentication & Role Management (Admin/Cashier)**

   * Login/Logout system -done
   * Role-based access control - done
   * Session management - done
   * Create a super admin manually or via migration -done

2. **Database Schema Design** -done

   * Design tables: Users, Products, Categories, Sales, Customers, Inventory, Transactions, etc.
   * Set up relationships (e.g., sales ‚Üí products, user ‚Üí transactions)

3. **Admin/Cashier Layout (UI structure)**

   * Build navigation sidebar/menu for both Admin and Cashier dashboards
   * Create blank pages/components for all major sections (placeholders)

---

### **üü° PHASE 2: Product & Inventory Core**

These modules are the backbone of your POS system. You can't sell without products or inventory.

4. **Product Management (Admin)**

   * CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products
   * Categories, suppliers, variants
   * Upload product images, add price, barcode field

5. **Inventory Management (Admin)**

   * Stock levels and adjustments
   * Add purchase stock
   * Reorder point notifications

---

### **üîµ PHASE 3: POS (Cashier Core Functionality)**

Cashier system is your front-facing sales engine. It depends on product and inventory being ready.

6. **POS / New Sale Page (Cashier)**

   * Scan/add product
   * Cart management (add, remove, quantity)
   * Checkout functionality
   * Generate receipt (basic)
   * Record transaction in DB

7. **Customer Management (Cashier)**

   * Add customer during checkout (optional)
   * Search existing customers

8. **Sales History / Transactions (Cashier)**

   * List of past sales
   * View receipt/transaction details

---

### **üü£ PHASE 4: Admin Control Panel & Oversight**

9. **Dashboard / Overview (Admin)**

   * Total sales, top products, low stock alerts
   * Sales chart (line or bar graph)
   * Summary cards (daily sales, customers, products)

10. **Sales & Transactions (Admin)**

* Filter/search sales by cashier, date, payment
* Refunds & return logic
* Export to PDF/Excel

11. **Customer Management (Admin)**

* View/edit customer info
* Purchase history
* Loyalty points (if applicable)

---

### **üü§ PHASE 5: Reporting, Logs, and Advanced Features**

12. **Reports & Analytics**

* Sales reports (daily/monthly/yearly)
* Inventory valuation
* Cashier performance
* Exportable PDF/Excel reports

13. **System Logs / Audit Trail**

* Log user actions (login, delete, update)
* Stock change logs
* Security and accountability

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 6: Final Settings & Polishing**

14. **Settings / Configuration**

* Business details (name, logo, address)
* Tax rates and currency
* Receipt template customization
* Payment methods (cash, card, mobile)

15. **Email/SMS Notifications (Optional)**

* For customers or low stock alerts

---

### **üì¶ Final Steps**

16. **Testing & Debugging**

* Manual and automated tests
* Test for different roles and flows

17. **User Interface Polish**

* Responsive design
* Error messages, validations, feedback

18. **Deployment & Documentation**

* Deploy to production server
* Write user manuals or onboarding guide

---

### üîÅ Notes:

* You can build it iteratively: deliver a **basic MVP** first (Login + Products + POS), then enhance.
* Always **version control** your code (use Git)
* Focus on **data integrity** (especially sales and stock)

Would you like me to break this plan into a **Gantt chart or task list for Trello/Notion/Excel**?
